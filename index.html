        <h1> More about Dogs</h1>
    <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, <br> not natural wild animals. They were originally <br> bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long <br> time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. ... They <br> are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal <br> and listen to humans.</p>
