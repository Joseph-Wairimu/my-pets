  <h1> More about dogs</h1>
<p>Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans <br> do their work. They are a popular pet because they are <br> usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the <br> United States are registered as pets.[5] Dogs eat both meat <br> and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs <br> often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, <br> fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue <br> dogs.</p>
