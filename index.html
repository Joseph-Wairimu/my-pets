        <h1> About Dogs</h1>
    <p style="color:yellow">Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, <br> not natural wild animals. They were originally <br> bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long <br> time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. ... They <br> are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal <br> and listen to humans.</p>

    <h1> More about dogs</h1>
    <p>Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans <br> do their work. They are a popular pet because they are <br> usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the <br> United States are registered as pets.[5] Dogs eat both meat <br> and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs <br> often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, <br> fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue <br> dogs.</p>

            <h1>Appearance and behaviour</h1>
            <p>Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. <br> Dogs often chase cats, and most dogs will fetch a ball or stick. <br>

            Dogs can smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well <br> in color because they are color blind. Due to the anatomy of the eye, dogs <br> can see better in dim light than humans. They also have a wider field <br> of vision.
            
            Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups <br> called packs. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank <br> will submit to other dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called <br> the alpha male. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated <br> dogs often view their owner as the alpha male.[9]

<h1>Lifespan</h1>
<p>Different dog breeds have different lifespans. In <br> general, smaller dogs live longer than bigger ones.[10] The <br> size and the breed of the dog change how long the <br> dog lives, on average. Breeds such as the Dachshund usually live for <br> fifteen years, Chihuahuas can reach age twenty. The Great Dane, <br> on the other hand has an average lifespan of six <br> to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for ten years.
